        /*Array syntax is slightly different in java.
            syntax - var <var-name> = new Array(list of items);
                   - when accessing an element: <var-name>[index]     
        other ways to create an array - var <var-name> = new Array(numberofItemsToBeListed); 
                    - var <var-name> = new Array(); // if we don't know how much items our array wants to hold   
        *Arrays have properties since they are built-in objects. The most commonly used property is length.  
        *Arrays can be formed by combining two or more arrays
        This is achieved through the Array method called concat(); Another method called <Array-name>.join(optional parameter); converts the array to string
            pop(); method removes the last element in an Array.
            reverse(); method creates another array starting from the end
            push(); opposite of pop method since it adds one or more multiple elements.
            sort(); sorts the array and creates an array of sorted order
        *Array summation can be faciliated using loops
        prompt("Prompt question:", ""); is a built in javascript function which takes two parameters     
        *Associative Array - using other characters to index other than numbers
